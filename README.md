# ðŸš€ Launch List

Personal reference pre-launch list. See markdown file for complete list of easily-missed things to do before launching a project. Not everything listed appliest to every project. I like to copy this into a repos /todo.md. 

Also in this repo is an html file that could be made into a list with checkboxes (no local storage/cookie stuff here) - no contents, but with some sublime-parcour could easily be done.
