# ðŸš€ Launch List

Websites are never finished - but some are launched more complete than others!

Building websites is the best. I love hitting a "flow state" and working fast. That is most responsible when there is also a step for making sure everything is done - including the easily forgotten things.

## What this is

Personal reference pre-launch list. See markdown file for complete list of easily-missed things to do before launching a project. I like to copy this into a repo's `todo.md`. It can be opinionated in that it's largely approaching development with OOCSS design-systems in mind.

This can also be a handy reference when reviewing someone else's work with fresh-eyes.


## What this isn't

This is not prescriptive of workflows, nor is everything listed relevant to every project. There is assumption and bias all throughout this - like that the content is thought out, hosting solved etc.
